        <h4 id="Overview">Overview</h4>
        <p>The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) encompasses multi-disciplinary programs at the interface 
            between the traditional fields of natural history, environmental biology, and natural resource management.
             Primary foci are the management of sustainable fisheries of commercially important species; biocomplexity
              and ecosystem-based management; and sustainable aquaculture. In addition, human-induced effects on natural 
              ecosystems (including habitat change and restoration, impacts of climate change, emerging diseases, the effects 
              of invasive species, and processes affecting endangered species and declining populations) are major areas 
              of research. In pursuit of these objectives, a variety of basic sciences are used, including ecology and evolution,
               population biology, behavior, physiology, microbiology, and genetics. The scope of aquatic systems ranges from watersheds, 
               rivers and lakes, to estuarine and near-shore shelf, open ocean systems and culture facilities. Graduates of the
                School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences are uniquely qualified for careers in universities as well as other 
                educational settings, natural resources management agencies at the local to international levels, environmental 
                consulting, and non-profit organizations with an environmental focus.

        <h5>Aquatic and Fishery Sciences</h5>
        <p>Minor Requirements: Minimum 28 credits to include three courses (two of 
            which must be at least at the 300 level) from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>FISH 101</li>
            <li>FISH 250</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Minimum two upper-division FISH courses totaling at least 8 credits. Maximum 11 credits may overlap with a student's major.</p>
        <h5>Marine Biology</h5>
        <p>The minor in marine biology is sponsored jointly by the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, the School of Oceanography, 
            and the College of Arts and Sciences, and is designed to immerse 
            students in the study of marine organisms and ecosystems, starting in the freshman year. Because the experience of marine sciences
             cannot be taught entirely within the classroom, the minor is structured to provide ample opportunity for fieldwork and 
             research within the coursework. A description of the minor can be found under the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/marinebiology.html">
                Interdisciplinary Undergraduate 
                Program</a> section of the catalog.</p>
        <h5>Quantitative Science</h5>
        <p>Students interested in quantitative skills applied to biological and ecological fields should consider minoring in quantitative science, an 
            interdisciplinary minor supported by the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences and the School of Enviromental and Forest Sciences. 
            More information may be found on the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/cqs/">Center for Quantitative Science website.</a></p>
