        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>At the University of Washington, some highly popular majors are “capacity-constrained” which means that they do not allow all students who are interested to enroll in the major. Students often have to face intense competition and deal with complex application requirements to declare a major. Many students, after being rejected to multiple majors, are left with few choices and might eventually have to graduate with a non-competitive degree they have no interest in. According to the article <a href="https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_4c9b1c78-d4a7-11e7-9300-e3d0797c9e23.html"><cite>Admission with a Caveat</cite></a> by the UW Daily, major applicatiom can cause tremendous competition and stress for students. The department admission requirements are also different for every major, and there isn’t a comprehensive place that guides students to find information on their major of interest. Currently, the UW Degree Programs is designed to guide students on declaring and graduating from a major, but it can be very overwhelming to read. The interface as well as information are not up to date on the UW Degree Programs. This causes additional stress and anxiety for students and could be solved with a more user-friendly and easy to understand platform. We hope to create an interface that can guide students and provide accurate information to reduce confusion and increase confidence and clarity for students.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The users of the application will be undergraduate students at the University of Washington, 
            specifically for students who have not delcared a major yet. This application can also be used for students 
            who are trying to decide what courses to take to fulfill their department requirements. 
            In addition, academic advisers can also use this application to guide students and help them 
            with the application processes for their interest of major.
        </p>
        <p>
            The users of the application will be viewing information from the UW websites. Most of the information that the users will be viewing will 
            be drawn from the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/degree_programsTOC.html">UW Degree Programs</a> website. 
            Information from UW's <a href="https://myplan.uw.edu/home/#/">MyPlan</a> website will also be condensed into our application to help 
            users easily find the descriptions of the courses they are interested in. 
            The <a href="http://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/">list of undergraduate majors</a> on the UW website
            and their capacity will also be used as information to help develop our web application. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The web application will be a comprehensive platform for all separate department information. Users will be able to interact with the application by choosing how to filter the majors they want to explore. 
            Additionally, users can also interact with the application by typing and searching by department or major. Users will also be able to click onto external links for more information. For example, 
            users can click on a link for a required course, which will take the user to the MyPlan description of the course. Our app will help solve the problems of students feeling overwhelmed, lost and confused, 
            and therefore help students succeed academically. By providing a user-friendly app, students will be able to navigate and explore their major of interest with ease. Our app will allow users to prepare 
            and start early in academic planning, providing a seamless experience for those who are struggling.
