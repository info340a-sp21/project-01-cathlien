            The web application will be a comprehensive platform for all separate department information. Users will be able to interact with the application by choosing how to filter the majors they want to explore. 
            Additionally, users can also interact with the application by typing and searching by department or major. Users will also be able to click onto external links for more information. For example, 
            users can click on a link for a required course, which will take the user to the MyPlan description of the course. Our app will help solve the problems of students feeling overwhelmed, lost and confused, 
            and therefore help students succeed academically. By providing a user-friendly app, students will be able to navigate and explore their major of interest with ease. Our app will allow users to prepare
