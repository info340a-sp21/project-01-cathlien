        <h4>Things to consider before choosing a major:</h4>
        <h5 id="Credits">Graduation credits</h5>
        <p>Before declaring a major or applying for one, it is important to consider whether the major requirement for graduation is aligned with your own academic plans. If you already have many credits before declaration of the major, consult with an academic advisor before commiting to a major.</p>
        <h5 id="Interests">Interests, values, and abilities</h5>
        <p>One of the biggest factor in choosing a major is your own passion and interests. What do you enjoy learning? What do you do in your free time? What topics of conversation do you find most engaging? These are important questions to ask yourself when choosing a major. Also consider whether a major fits into your values and abilities. You will have a much better college experience if you choose a major that you are good at and actually enjoy studying.</p>
        <h5></h5>
        <h5 id="Career">Career Path</h5>
        <p>It is important to choose a major that you would like to have a career in. Consider the line of work that suites you the best and your "dream job". What skills does this job require? What kinds of people succeed in this role? What are the technical and soft skills needed for this job? Of course, you may find yourself changing your career path down the line, but choosing a major that aligns with your current anticipated career path puts you in a great spot for the future. Another important factor is to consider the wages of graduates of different majors. Economic factor is an important one. Fivethirtyeight has a great dataset regarding the employment, unemployment, median wages and many more. </p>
