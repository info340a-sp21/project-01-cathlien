        <p>The Program on the Environment (PoE) is the home for Environmental Studies education at the University of Washington. Environmental Studies focuses on the interactions between humans and environments, drawing on an interdisciplinary approach to understand and address complex environmental issues.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Studies program offers a BA major in Environmental Studies, a minor in Environmental Studies, and a Graduate Certificate in Environmental Management.</p>
        <p>Building on a foundation of natural science, social science, and humanities courses, the curriculum offers students flexibility in choosing an individual course of study. Internship, research, and study abroad opportunities develop skills and leadership for careers in environmental policy, sustainability, conservation, education, or consulting.</p>
